            <h1 class="writing projectTitle" style="font-size: 30px; "><b>Illinois Business Consulting </b></h1>
            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;"> Illinois Business Consulting (IBC) is the nation's largest student-led consulting organization. Every semester, students are placed on a new project, where they work with real-world clients on a semester-long project.
            I was accepted into IBC freshman year fall semester, where my journey in this incredible organization began. As a first-semester consultant, I learned how to perform primary and secondary research, and practiced slide-making and presenation
            skills through weekly presentations to our client. Working with a team of 8 consultants not only taught me the benefits and challenges that came with working in a team. I gradually became more adaptable to my teammates and enjoyed interacting with students from different majors, backgrounds, and ages. I witnessed the true beauty of diversity of thought. 
            The following semester, I was promoted to Senior Consultant(SC), where I worked as the liason between the consultants and the Project Manager(PM). In this position, I started to develop my leadership skills as I began to take more responsibility in leading consultants in the right direction and editing their slides, while also learning from my PM.The following semester, I worked as a Project Manager for a client who saught for a way to keep up with the technological revolution and 
            upgrade their tech to incorproate more software, rather than hardware, solutions. My responsibilities as a Project Manager included scoping the project, leading a team of 7 consultants, creating weekly workstreams, give and receive feedback, consistenly communicate with the client, and report back/update my Senior Manager(SM). Being a PM definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to take ownership of my work and understand how to be an effective
            leader. This included creating a comfortable and exciting environment for my consultants, keeping an open mind, establishing a standard for work quality and ethic, and a LOT of multi-tasking. My next milestone within the organization was becoming a Senior Manager, where I was responsible for leading 3 different teams with 3 different clients. In the Spring 2020 semester, I managed projects in the FinTech, Supply Chain, and AI/ML industries which was eye-openeing to dive into different industries and understand their various pain points.
            I realized projects are most successful when I take the time to build a personal relationship with the PM's I mentor. When my PM and I are comfortable with each other, they are more inclined to ask questions and be more open with me. While managing 3 projects at once, I learned the importance of staying organized, learning how to handle unforseen circumstances, being an effective and clear communicator, being adaptable to my PMs and the 21 people on the 3 teams, and make an effective use of my time. IBC has grown me into the person I am today and I can't wait to see how I'll grow in the upcoming semester!

            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;">Illinois Consulting Academy (ICA) is a consulting bootcamp that fosters a diverse student consulting community collectively focused on developing whole students, that think critically, build authentic relationships, and lead courageously to solve the world’s toughest problems.
            This academy consisted of a class in which industry professionals from consulting organizations such as Deloitte, PwC, Bain & Company, HBR, etc. talked to us about a mariad of real-world consutling skills and introducing frameworks such as Porter's 5 Forces, the 5 C's, etc. In addition, each student practiced casing with a Course Assistant on a weekly basis. This was extremely insightful as I properly undrstood how to 
            answer market sizing questions, how to break down an open-ended problem and analyze data to come to a conclusion, and how to practice vocalizing my thought process. After the semester, I can undoubtedly say I have gained a great deal of industry knowledge and problem-solving skills that I can apply in any path I go forward with.

            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;">Coming to UIUC from Jersey was a HUGE change for me. It was hard make friend groups at a State college where a handful of freshmen were coming to school with their friend groups from highschool.
        As a first semester freshman, I had no idea what a business fraternity was and had no intention of rushing either. However, after hearing nothing but positive remarks about these organizations, I decided to rush my second semester of freshman year. I am ETERNALLY grateful I made that decision
        because I was immediately able to find my "home away from home". Phi Gamma Nu was filled with inviting, intelligent, and energetic people that I loved surrounding myself with. Two years in, I've met my best friends and gained an incredible amount of advice from upperclassmen and my big brother & alumni relationships.
        As cliche as it sounds, I truly have been able to grow in every pillar PGN supports- professional, social, and philanthropic. I have been able to give back to my local CU community through events such as Prairie Winds- where we go to the local senior citizen house and play BINGO with seniors, or C-U at Home events, where
        we visit the local homeless shelter and play games and give company to the individuals at the shelter. PGN has made me a better person and is a huge reason I fell in love with UIUC. I am so incredibly thankful for the relationships I've made and the life-long friendships I'll take with me.

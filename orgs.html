            <h1 class="writing projectTitle" style="font-size: 30px; "><b>Illinois Business Consulting </b></h1>
            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;"> Illinois Business Consulting (IBC) is the nation's largest student-led consulting organization. IBC has hands-down been my most valuable college experience. 
            Not only has it introduced me to the world of consulting, but its thoroughly advanced my professional skillsets. Every semester, students are placed on a new project, where they work with real-world clients on a semester-long project.
            I was accepted into IBC the first semester of freshman year, where my journey in this incredible organization began. As a first-semester consultant, I learned how to perform primary and secondary research, practiced slide-making and presenation
            skills through weekly presentations to our client. Working with a team of 8 consultants not only taught me integral teamwork and collaboration skillsbut also allowed me to interact with students from different majors, leading to diversity of thought. Soon after, I 
            was promoted to Senior Consultant, where I worked as the liason between the consultants and the Project Manager. The following semester, I worked as a Project Manager for a client who saught for a way to keep up with the technological revolution and 
            upgrade their tech to incorproate more software solutions. My responsibilities as a Project Manager included scoping the project, leading a team of 7 consultants, creating weekly workstreams, challenging my consultants to think "big-picture," give them opportunities
            to grow and work on their weaknesses, give & receive feedback, consistenly communicate with the client, and report back/update by Senior Manager. This experience pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to take ownership of my work and understand how to be an effective
            leader. My next milestone within the organization was becoming a Senior Manager, where I was responsible for leading 3 different teams, working with 3 different clients. Here, I felt like I really reached my peak. I learned how to multitask and switch mindsets in order to focus at the project at hand.
            This past semester, I managed a FinTech, Supply Chain, and AI/ML project which was eye-openeing to dive into different industries and understand their pain points.
            I realized projects are most successful when I take the time to build a personal relationship with the PM's I mentor. When my PM and I are comfortable with each other, they are more inclined to ask questions and be more open with me. While managing 3 projects at once, 
            I learned the importance of staying organized, being an effective and clear communicator, and being adaptable to my PMs and the 21 people on the 3 teams. IBC has grown me into the person I am today and I can't wait to see where else it'll take me.

            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;">Illinois Consulting Academy (ICA) is a consulting bootcamp that fosters a diverse student consulting community collectively focused on developing whole students, that think critically, build authentic relationships, and lead courageously to solve the world’s toughest problems.
            This academy consisted of a class in which industry professionals from consulting organizations such as Deloitte, PwC, Bain, HBR, etc. talked to us about a mariad of real-world consutling skills such as .... In addition, each student practiced casing with a Course Assistant on a weekly basis. This was extremely insightful as I properly undrstood how to 
            answer market sizing questions, how to break down an open-ended problem and analyze data to come to a conclusion, and how to practice vocalizing my thought process. After the semester, I can undoubtedly say I have gained a great deal of industry knowledge and problem-solving skills that I can apply in any path I go forward with.

            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;">Coming to UIUC from Jersey was a HUGE change for me. It was hard make friend groups at a State college where a handful of freshmen were coming to school with their friend groups from highschool.
        As a first semester freshman, I had no idea what a business fraternity was and had no intention of rushing either. However, after hearing nothing but positive remarks about these organizations, I decided to rush my second semester of freshman year. I am ETERNALLY grateful I made that decision
        because I was immediately able to find my home away from home. Phi Gamma Nu was filled with inviting, intelligent, and energetic people that I loved surrounding myself with. Two years in, I've met my best friends, gained an incredible amount of advice from upperclassmen and my big brother & alumni relationships.
        As cliche as it sounds, I have been able to grow in every pillar PGN supports- professional, social, and philanthropic. I have been able to give back to my local CU community through events such as Prairie Winds- where we go to the local senior citizen house and play BINGO with seniors, or C-U at Home events, where
        we visit the local shelter and talk to the homeless and less fortunate and connect with them on a deeper level. I am so incredibly thankful for the relationships I've made and the life-long friendships I'll take with me.

            <h1 class="writing projectTitle" style="font-size: 30px; "><b>Panasonic</b></h1>
            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;"> This summer, I worked with Panasonic in making one of their enterprise software more robust. Panasonic has tons of pick-and-place machines that are used to manufacture circuit boards. These machines are made of several different components such as
        feeders, nozzles, reels, etc. With Panasonic's current system, when there is an error in the production line, workers have to manually turn the production line off, intervene and throw out the defective
     circuit boards, fix the machine, and restart it. What we as interns sought to do was first, analyze the machine data to find trends of when and why the machines are failing, and then feeding that hypothesis
        into a machine learning model that will predict when errors occur. This will allow Panasonic employees to know when and why their feeders are failing so they can take preventative measures to avoid wasting materials. In order to do ths, the team first had to explore different machine learning models and compare results to choose the one that will 
        give us the best prediction accuracy. We compared Random Forest and XGBoost and came to the conclusion that XGBoost would be the best option. We measured the performance of these algorithms through metrics such as MCC, Kappa, F-1 Score, and ROC. This is because the "Accuracy" metric is not an accurate (ironically) method to know how good your model is if you're working with an imbalanced dataset, which we were. 
        This meant that the instances of failures in the data were WAY fewer than the instances of non-failures. In order to combat this, we used SMOTE, ADASYN, and Random oversampling and compared the outcomes to see which one we should go with.
         In the end, after weeks of analyzing the data and understanding the relationships between the variables the team, we prepared a machine learning model that would output if their is a feeder, reel, or nozzle problem. Currently, we are in the process of deploying the model.  </p>

            <p class="projectDescription" style="font-size: 18px;  text-align: justify;">Even though I was supposed to be living it up in Chicago this summer with Deloitte, I had an AMAZING time during the two week program 
            Deloitte put together. During this program, the interns were split into groups and each assigned a shared value of deloitte to design our Innovation Project around. My group was assigned "Inclusion," which meant we had to think
            of any problem related to Inclusion in today's society and prototype a technology solution that could be used to solve it. Naturally, my group thought of the problems society is enduring during this pandemic, as well as the recent spread of awareness of systemic racism. Small businesses have been severely impact by COVD-19, 
            ESPECIALLY minority-owned small businesses. The innovation our team proposed was Xilli. Xilli is a platform that not only allows local consumers to get connected to their local minority-owned small businesses, but also allows businesses access
            to important business training (Marketing, Branding, Technology, etc.) With Xilli, we are bringing our community together while supporting those in need. My two weeks with Delotite were extremelely memorable. I was able to make great 
            friends, learn a ton about the different technologies being used across different industries, and also improve upon my entrepreneurial skill set.</p>
